# EyanaSSD - Explore the Inner Workings of Solid-State Drives with Data Visualization

## Overview

EyanaSSD is an innovative educational and research tool designed to provide an intuitive visual representation of the internal workings of SSDs, including NAND flash memory cells. The simulator offers real-time data visualization, workload analysis, and an interactive experience to enhance understanding of SSD behavior.

## Features

### 1. **Intuitive Visualization**

- The EyanaSSD Simulator provides a two-dimensional display that visualizes key SSD metrics.
- Users can monitor continuous writing patterns and understand SSD architecture.

### 2. **Workload Analysis**

- Supports comprehensive evaluation of various workloads:
  - **Sequential**
  - **Uniform Random**
  - **Zipf Distributions**
- Uses data sourced from **FEMU** for real-world SSD performance analysis.

### 3. **Educational Value**

- Over a thousand users praise its effectiveness in saving time and improving SSD comprehension.
- Ideal for students, researchers, and engineers interested in NAND flash memory and SSD operations.

### 4. **Simple and Easy Access**

- **Web-based**: The only web-based SSD simulator allowing users to upload workloads and explore features effortlessly.
- **Live monitoring**: Visualize real-time SSD processes interactively.

### 5. **User-Friendly Experience**

- Users can **upload workload files**, and the simulator automatically analyzes and provides clear insights.
- Supports multiple SSD visualization metrics.

## How Does EyanaSSD Work?

- Metrics are visualized in a **color-coded two-dimensional display** to show continuous writing patterns in SSDs.
- **Color Transition Explanation:**
  - **Bright Green to Dark Green**: Reflects a reduction in the number of invalid pages.
  - **Bright Pink to Light Pink**: Represents areas with decreasing invalid pages and lower erase counts.
  - **White to Pink-White**: Shows a balance between invalid pages and erase counts.
